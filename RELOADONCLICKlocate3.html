                <p>Children, I am TAY EHA Lakle. Your nearest greater grandfather.</p>
                <p>The other great grandparents live in Ada - where my parents came from to ANLO-land. The name of my Father is Eha Ashiapim - 1st, ( Priest Eha Ashiapim 1 ), the son of the old man called Ashiapim from Ada, who happen to be a chief priest to Nyegbla, in ANLO-land during those days I was born.</p>
                <p>My mother is Mama Edzortsa from Srogboe (Kpatamia house). I have a step mother called Aba Kukpo, who gave birth to my step-brothers such as Gagba and siblings at Avume Gagbakorpeh. (DO YOU KNOW MY REAL NAME?) OH! Ok.</p>
                <p>My real name is TAY EHA. So, Lakle is not the name my parents gave me. (do you want me to tell you how I got that name? Don't worry I shall tell you soon.) I married a beautiful woman called MEGBENYA HAFIA DZRAKI from Anloga. It is because of this woman that I got the name LAKLE. Thus, My inlaw (called Lakle), who is a king of Kpalime, gave me the name. LAKLE DORMEGBABA DIKUU, BE YE DA AMI WU Gbor. Ebe ye me nye Gbor deami gbor nu o. One day, the Tsiame clan members in person of Dzeble Kwaku commit a sin against the deity Nyegbla. At that time, the priest on Nyegbla's stool was EHA ASHIAPIM-1ST. The SIN was that, when Ashiapim Eha-1st, went to greet his priest Amedor Kpegla Bate VI, the Awoamefia of Anlo, Dzeble  Kwaku slapped him. This invoked a curse on the Tsiame clan. Years later, a war broke out at Agbeluwoe, a town in which Dzeble Kwaku had gone to trade with the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>To save their lives, Dzikunu, Nyamadrie, Tamekloe and Baninie took to their heels and came to Anloga. When they came, they reported to the family and the wife of Dzeble Kwaku [Awagashie], that he had been killed in the war. This was a total fabrication because Dzeble Kwaku was not killed as they claimed (or came to tell). At first, the family believed the death news of their beloved one. Therefore they made Hafia his elder brother, to marry his (Dzeble Kwaku) wife Awagasi Lakle. Not long after marrying to the woman, Dzeble Kwaku the supposed dead return with human heads from the war.</p>
                <p>This was alarming and caused panic. Awagasi Lakle however, run to the father at Kpalime upon realizing that the husband Dzeble Kwaku is still alive. Meanwhile during that period she was pregnant for HAFIA DRAKI (the big brother of Dzeble Kwaku).</p>
                <p>She does not believe the incidence happening in her life and as regard to her pregnancy. Due to that she had named the baby she borne Dzeble Kwaku Megbenya ko woanye (MEGBENYA in short).</p> 
                <p>This name means what she was going through can only happen in the absence of Dzeble Kwaku. Now the Tsiame clan need to solve their curse on them. When Mamma Megbenya was born, she was taken to the deity Nyegbla, as a reparation on behalf of the Tsiame Clan.</p>
                <p>The priest of the Nyegbla at that time was, Priest Eha Ashiapim-1st. Eha however betrothed her to his son Tay. Soon after the marriage to Tay, the Awoamefia of Kpalime came to Anlo and thanked the . Em, father of TAY declared End of War between the inhabitants of Anlos and his people.</p>
                <p>As a symbol, he gave his royal name LAKLE to Tay Eha (who is now his grandson in-law) that is known as Lakle Dormegbaba. Lakle Rikui. Appellatively hailed, Lakle Dormegbaba be ye dami wu gbor. LAKLE RIKUU, Ebe ye me nye Gbor deami gbor nu o. (the port-belly leopard or panther which says he is fatter than goat, a lean panther which says he is nowhere equal to a fatty goat.)</p>
                <p>The marriage of TAY LAKLE EHA to MEGBENYA however, enable Tay to own LAKLE, and also resulted in the descendants of EHA ASHIAPIM to obtain land from the family of Amedor Kpeglah - the Bate king as well as land from the Tovie Clan.</p>
                <p>Tunu township believes the mangrove is their Cocoa, they grow it, and when the bush matured they cut it into uniform lengths and dyed them. When the logs are drenched off water, they then would tie a considerable volume and place a monetary value on a bundle. The one beauty of the business is that, each bundle appeared to be the same in volume after they are tied.</p>
                <p>People from far buy the bundles and use them for cooking or other fires.</p>
