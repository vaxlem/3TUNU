    <h1>The 12 Men of Ada</h1>
    <p>
        LONG time ago, by the 17th centuries, there lived a family of 12 strong men in Ada, in the greater Accra region of Ghana.
        <br> The name of some of them are;
        Ashiapim,
        Kabutey and
        Asimasinne (also known as LE). The following persons are their relatives. They are; the Ocanseys, the Kubis, the Shamateys among others.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h1>the migration</h1>
    <p>
        One day, in a very long time, three (3) of these children moved to Anlo-Land. They came to Anloga because the people of Anlo invited them to come and help them. So they left their nine (9) siblings/brothers at Ada and came to Anlo land. When they came, they carry with them their war god to use.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>good works</h2>
    <p>
        The 3 brothers did good works in Anlo land and made many families with the Anlos too. And the people of Anlo also rewarded them with lots of properties.
    </p>
    They had children and Ashiapim also gave birth.

    <h2>torgbui Ashiapim</h2>
    <p>
        He became the chief priest to their fetish - Nyegbla at that time in Anlo. His full priesthood name was Ashiapim - 1ST
